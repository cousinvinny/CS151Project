To: Graduate Admissions Committee

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Vinh Nguyen who is applying for the Master of business administration (MBA) in your school. I met Vinh in Summer 2023 when he enrolled in my "PHIL94" course.

Vinh earned "A" from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker He is.

He also earned "A" from my "CS151: Object-Oriented Design", "A" from my "CS166: Information Security", "C" from my "CS154: Theory of Computation courses.

Vinh submitted well-written assignments, and worked hard.

He was always very passionate, punctual, and attentive.

Furthermore, I noticced from the term project, He, developed leadership, time managment, and problem-solving skills. He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks approriately. They were able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that Vinh Nguyen has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.



Very Respectfully,
