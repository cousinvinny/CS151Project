I am writing this letter to recommend my former student test test who is applying for the Master of science (MS) in your school. I met test in Spring test when he enrolled in my "test" course.

test earned "test" from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker She is.

She also earned "test" from my "CS151: Object-Oriented Design courses.

test submitted well-written assignments.

She was always very passionate.

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project, She, developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills. She worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. They were able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that test test has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.
