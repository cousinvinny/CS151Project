To: Graduate Admissions Committee

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student SFDS sERSE who is applying for the Master of science (MS) in your school. I met SFDS in Summer RSE when he enrolled in my "SFD" course.

SFDS earned "WER" from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker She is.

She also earned "S" from my "CS166: Information Security courses.

SFDS submitted well-written assignments, and participated in all of my class activities.

She was always very enthusiastic.

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project, She, developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills. She worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. They were able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that SFDS sERSE has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.



Very Respectfully,
