I am writing this letter to recommend my former student John Smith who is applying for the Master of science (MS) in your school. I met John in Fall 2022 when he enrolled in my "CMPE102: Assmbly Language" course.

John earned "A" from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker He is.

He also earned "A" from my "CS151: Object-Oriented Design", "B" from my "CS166: Information Security", "A" from my "CS154: Theory of Computation", "B" from my "CS160: Software Engineering", "A" from my "CS256: Cryptography", "B" from my "CS146: Data Structures and Algorithms", "A" from my "CS152: Programming Languages Paradigm courses.

John submitted well-written assignments, participated in all of my class activities, worked hard, was very well prepared for every exam and assignment, picked up new skills quickly, and was able to excel academically at the top of my class.

He was always very passionate, very enthusiastic, punctual, attentive, and polite.

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project, He, developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills. He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. They were able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that John Smith has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.
