To: Graduate Admissions Committee

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Jack Trace who is applying for the Doctor of philosophy (PhD) in your school. I met Jack in Summer 2044 when he enrolled in my "PHIL22" course.

Jack earned "B" from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker She is.

She also earned "A" from my "CS151: Object-Oriented Design courses.

Jack submitted well-written assignments.

She was always very passionate.

Furthermore, I noticced from the term project, She, developed leadership, time managment, and problem-solving skills. She worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks approriately. They were able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that Jack Trace has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.



Very Respectfully,
