I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Please John who is applying for the Master of science (MS) in your school. I met Please in Summer 2023 when he enrolled in my "CS143" course.

Please earned "A" from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker He is.

He also earned "A" from my "CS151: Object-Oriented Design", "B" from my "CS256: Cryptography courses.

Please submitted well-written assignments, participated in all of my class activities, worked hard, was very well prepared for every exam and assignment, and picked up new skills quickly.

He was always very passionate, very enthusiastic, and punctual.

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project, He, developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills. He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. They were able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that Please John has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him.
